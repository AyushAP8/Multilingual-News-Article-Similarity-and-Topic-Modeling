The driver of the car was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name was not immediately released.\\n\\nThe suspect\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vehicle also hit a deputy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cruiser before being stopped, Keller said.\\n\\nBraithwaite was being held without bond in the Eastern Regional Jail.

But the town, like many others, was hit by violent protests that began in September amid anger over corruption, fuel shortages and dwindling food supplies as opposition leaders and supporters demanded the resignation of Mo\\xc3\\xafse. More than 40 people have been killed and dozens injured.\\n\\nLarge-scale protests in Port-au-Prince have since dissipated, although smaller ones are still occurring elsewhere in the country. On Wednesday, opposition leaders and supporters gathered in Gonaives to attend the funeral of an anti-government protester and then carried his coffin through the streets as more protesters joined them.\\n\\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

       "        b\"BERLIN - A fire raced through a zoo in western Germany in the first few minutes of the new year, killing more than 30 animals, including apes, monkeys, bats and birds, authorities said. Police said paper sky lanterns launched nearby to celebrate the arrival of 2020 were probably to blame.\\n\\nSeveral witnesses saw cylindrical paper lanterns with little fires inside flying in the night sky shortly after midnight Wednesday near the Krefeld Zoo, Gerd Hoppmann, the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head of criminal police, told reporters.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople reported seeing those sky lanterns flying at low altitude near the zoo and then it started burning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hoppmann said.\\n\\nHe said investigators also found used lanterns on the ground that hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t burned entirely. They were 34 centimetres long, made out of white paper with an opening at the bottom where a small fire would be suspended. The fire heats the air inside, making them fly and shine at night.\\n\\nPolice and firefighters received the first emergency calls at 12:38 a.m.\\n\\nThe zoo near the Dutch border said its entire ape house burned down and more than 30 animals \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including five orangutans, two gorillas, a chimpanzee and several monkeys \\xe2\\x80\\x94 were killed, as well as fruit bats and birds.\\n\\nOnly two chimpanzees were able to be rescued from the flames by firefighters. They suffered burns but are in stable condition, zoo director Wolfgang Dressen said.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close to a miracle that Bally, a 40-year-old female chimpanzee, and Limbo, a younger male, survived this inferno,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dressen said, adding that many of the zoo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s animal handlers were in shock at the devastation.\\n\\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have to seriously work through the mourning process,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dressen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is an unfathomable tragedy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe said many of the dead animals were close to extinction in the wild.\\n\\nThe zoo said the Gorilla Garden, which is near its devastated Ape House, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go up in flames and that gorilla Kidogo and six other members of his family are alive.\\n\\nGermans usually welcome in the new year with fireworks at midnight and people are allowed to buy and launch fireworks. Sky lanterns, however, are both illegal and uncommon in Krefeld and most of Germany. The mini hot-air balloons made of paper have been used in Asia for centuries.\\n\\nAfter requests by police for witnesses to come forward, Krefeld police said several people had come in and were being interrogated.

Sivan told reporters at its headquarters in Bengaluru, according to an official telecast.\\n\\nThe Chandrayaan-2 mission in September successfully deployed a lunar orbiter that relays scientific data back to earth, but was unable to place a rover on the lunar surface after a \"hard\" landing.\\n\\nThat mission had aimed to land on the south pole of the moon, where no other lunar mission had gone before. The region is believed to contain water as craters in the region are largely unaffected by the high temperatures of the sun.\\n\\nISRO had hoped to confirm the presence of water in the form of ice, first detected on its mission in 2008.\\n\\nChandrayaan-3 will have a \"similar configuration\" as the previous mission, Sivan said.\\n\\nOnly the United States, Russia and China have landed on the moon. Beijing\\'s Chang\\'e-4 probe touched down on the far side of the moon last year, while Israel made an unsuccessful attempt to land its Beresheet spacecraft on the moon in April 2019.\\n\\nIndia\\'s third lunar mission will likely launch in 2020 and will cost less than its previous mission, the PTI news agency reported on Tuesday, citing Jitendra Singh, junior minister for the department of space.\\n\\nSivan also said ISRO was making \"good progress\" for its human space-flight mission slated for late 2021, adding that four astronauts had been picked for training, which will be planned later this month. The project, called Gaganyaan, would cost less than 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion), the government said in 2018.\\n\\nIndia has developed a reputation for pioneering affordable satellite launches and space missions. Its unmanned Mars mission in 2014 cost just $74 million, less than the budget of the Hollywood space blockbuster \"Gravity\".\\n\\nSivan also announced that ISRO had begun the land acquisition process for a second spaceport in the southern port city of Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu state.\\n\\n(Reporting by Sachin Ravikumar; Editing by Kim Coghill)',\n",

       "        b'The government on Wednesday slashed import duty on refined palmolein from 50 per cent to 45 per cent, while that on crude palm oil (CPO) from 40 per cent to 37.5 per cent with immediate effect, a move that the industry opposed saying it will hurt domestic refiners. A notification in this regard has been issued by the finance ministry.\\n\\nThe duty cut has been made under the ASEAN agreement and the India-Malaysia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (IMCECA), the notification added. Opposing the move, the Solvent Extractors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Association of India (SEA) said that after the reduction in import duty, the tax difference between CPO and refined palmolein has reduced from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis will have serious impact on domestic palm oil refining industry and oilseeds farmers. We fear import of refined palmolien would increase and capacity utilisation of our industry would be affected leading to potential loss of employment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SEA Executive Director B V Mehta said in a statement.\\n\\nAfter a long time, the domestic oilseeds had started selling their produce above the minimum support price (MSP). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLower import duty would make it difficult to defend MSP and the new found enthusiasm of the oilseed farmers would be dampened,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. The country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s edible oil imports are now touching 70 per cent of the consumption. The duty cut would be counterproductive and contrary to the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stated objective of increasing domestic oilseed production, he added. Asserting that India too should protect the interest of farmers like Malaysia and Indonesia, the SEA said Indonesia from January 1 has imposed export duty of USD 50 on CPO and USD 30 on refined palmolien.\\n\\nSimilarly, Malaysia has imposed export duty of USD 31 on CPO and zero duty on refined palmolein which work out to be nearly 5 per cent on CPO value, thus effective duty difference is hardly 2.5 per cent only. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe strongly appeal to the government to increase the duty differential between CPO and refined palm oil to 15 per cent, by taking appropriate measures,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the industry body added.',\n",

       "        b'From The Guardian\\n\\nFrom Boeing to Whole Foods, companies are touting social responsibility as profits soar. Don\\'t believe a word of it\\n\\nCorporate social responsibility is the second-biggest con of 2019 (Donald Trump remains in first place).\\n\\nConsider Boeing, whose board just fired its CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, in order \"to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders.\"\\n\\nRestore confidence? Muilenburg\\'s successor will be David Calhoun, who, as a longstanding member of Boeing\\'s board of directors, allowed Muilenburg to remain CEO for more than a year after the first 737 Max crash and after internal studies found that the jetliner posed an unacceptable risk of accident. It caused the deaths of 346 people.\\n\\nMuilenburg raked in $30m in 2018. He could walk away from Boeing with another $60m.\\n\\nBoeing isn\\'t the only large corporation with a confidence problem. Until his ouster, Muilenburg was a director of the Business Roundtable, an association of 192 CEOs of America\\'s largest corporations. With great fanfare last August, it announced a \"fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders\" (emphasis in the original) and not just their shareholders.\\n\\nThe Roundtable\\'s commitment came in response to growing public distrust of big corporations, and proposals from several Democratic candidates to rein them in.\\n\\nAnother Business Roundtable director is Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors. Just weeks after making the commitment, and despite GM\\'s hefty profits and large tax breaks, Barra rejected workers\\' demands that GM raise their wages and stop outsourcing their jobs. Earlier in the year GM shut its giant assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio.\\n\\nAbout 50,000 GM workers then staged the longest auto strike in 50 years. They won a few wage gains but didn\\'t save any jobs. Meanwhile, GM\\'s stock has performed so well that Barra earned $22m last year.\\n\\nJeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, is another member of the Business Roundtable. Just weeks after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, Whole Foods, an Amazon subsidiary, announced it would be cutting medical benefits for its entire part-time workforce.\\n\\nThe annual saving to Amazon from this cost-cutting move is roughly what Bezos -- whose net worth is $110bn -- makes in two hours. (Bezos\\'s nearly completed DC mansion will have two elevators, 25 bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, and a movie theater.)\\n\\nGE\\'s CEO Larry Culp is also a member of the Business Roundtable. Two months after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, General Electric froze the pensions of 20,000 workers in order to cut costs. Culp raked in $15m last year.',\n",

       "        b'Police have arrested a 38-year-old black man from Orange Country, NY, for stabbing five Jews in the home of a Hasidic rabbi in Monsey on the seventh night of Hanukkah. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a New Yorker or a Jew or both, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asking why. Why has yet another African-American attacked Jews? Why has black-on-Jewish assault become a continuous feature of life in and around New York? Why now?\\n\\nThe answer: Because the country is seized by the politics of victimhood, and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing that self-pitying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvictims\\xe2\\x80\\x9d find easier than blaming Jews for their misery.\\n\\nThe names given to the bogeymen of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s populism are all historical code words for Jews. On the populist right, this means the elite, the globalists and the media. On the populist left, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Wall Street, the wealthy and the 1 percent. If that isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough, the left has also decided that Jews \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a minority who make up 2.2 percent of the American population \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are \\xe2\\x80\\x9chyper-white\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and, in Marxist terms, actually part of the power structure that keeps minorities down.\\n\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no secret that right-wing populism has facilitated a violent, sometimes deadly, rise in Jew-hatred, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forbidden to draw similar conclusions about the populist left. At least in public. There are two reasons for this: First, pointing out the problem on the right is a means of attacking President Trump. Second, addressing the problem on the left would mean facing the outsize role that black Americans have played in recent attacks against Jews.\\n\\nOn the first point, it is not only wrong to blame Trump for right-wing anti-Semitism, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perverse. How anyone gets away with claiming that the president doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t condemn Jew-hatred is beyond me. He condemns it at every turn. He devoted an unprecedentedly large chunk of his last State of the Union address to denouncing anti-Semitism and vowing to fight it wherever it may arise.\\n\\nTrump recently moved to crack down against anti-Semitism on college campuses (and was denounced for it as a racist by the left). For his commitment to fighting Jew-hatred and his unfaltering support of Israel, he has earned the enmity of far-right anti-Semites.\\n\\nOn the second point, the facts speak for themselves. Throughout 2019, African-Americans attacked Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn on a more-or-less weekly basis, and it barely ever made the mainstream news. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until two members of the Black Hebrew Israelites shot up a kosher market in Jersey City in early December that the media was forced into acknowledging reality.\\n\\nThe left\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading populists have fetishized the victim status of certain minorities, including African Americans. They have made slavery and its legacy the focal points of American life. They have determined, without evidence, that police are on a campaign to kill unarmed blacks. And they speak generally as if we have suddenly been transported to a pre-civil-rights-movement America.\\n\\nWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, unlike Trump, some of the left\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading populists have gone out of their way to steer their followers toward blaming the Jews. The stand-out figures here are Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Their public record of blaming Jewish money for corrupting American politics is so well-known that it needs no rehearsing here. And it has either been ignored or defended by the larger left. If you called either of them out on their anti-Semitism, you were charged with racism and misogyny. Omar so petrified Democratic leaders that they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even pass a House resolution condemning her blatant anti-Semitic remarks.\\n\\nBut the problem on the left goes beyond Omar and Tlaib. And it goes beyond the rest of the Squad, who engage in constant anti-Israel theatrics. It stretches to the identitarian populism of most of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, to the liberal garment-rending over the defeat of the anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn, to the intersectional gobbledygook that divides college campuses by ethnicity, to the Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s March activists who embrace Louis Farrakhan and down to the community level, where, for example, the NAACP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Passaic branch posts Facebook rants blaming tainted water supplies on the Jews.\\n\\nHistorically, indulged victims have needed no encouragement in pointing their finger at Jews. Telling them that others are responsible for their woes has usually been enough to get them headed in that direction. But some on today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left have given Jew-hatred an extra nudge. Their winks, dog-whistles and outright calumnies have served as a noxious propaganda campaign and led to a surge of minority anti-Semitism. With the attempted murders in Monsey, this can no longer be kept a secret, and maybe those who have facilitated it will begin to know a little shame.\\n\\nAbe Greenwald is senior editor of Commentary, from which this column was adapted.',\n",

       "        b\"Deal making in the Canadian gold sector went into overdrive in 2019 and industry players expect that is likely to continue in 2020, with smaller companies becoming targets as fund managers push the industry to create bigger, more diversified miners.\\n\\nIn 2019, $31.8-billion worth of gold-mining deals were announced, the largest on record for the Canadian gold sector, according to data from Refinitiv. Headline deals included Newmont Gold Corp.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s US$10-billion purchase of Goldcorp Inc., Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $4.9-billion bid for Detour Gold Corp. and China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd.'s planned acquisition of Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Continental Gold Inc. for $1.4-billion.\\n\\nThe merger and acquisitions bonanza is being driven by a number of factors, including the need for companies to replace reserves, cut costs, increase production and attract more interest from institutional investors. The move toward lower-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has pushed more money toward larger-cap companies that have membership in stock market indexes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that, in turn, is giving larger miners an advantage on the cost of capital over smaller ones.\\n\\nGiven that, a number of gold industry watchers say there are still too many smaller mining companies competing for a limited pool of capital \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a dynamic that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expected to drive even more M&A in 2020.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe industry is incredibly fragmented,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jon Case, precious metals portfolio manager with Sentry Inc. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just too many single asset companies. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense.\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\n\\nSingle asset miners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 those with only one mine, or one development project \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are seen as overly risky for many investors, Mr. Case said, and are being encouraged to find M&A suitors, as Detour Gold did with Kirkland Lake in 2019.\\n\\nCanadian companies in that category that are seen as possible targets in 2020 are Pretium Resources Inc. and Sabina Gold and Silver Corp., both based in Vancouver.\\n\\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbigger is better\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mantra is also likely to motivate more deal making. The rapid growth of index-tracking ETFs means the bigger a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weighting is within a gold index, the more buying it gets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 regardless of its fundamentals.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more important than ever to be big,\\xe2\\x80\\x9c said Peter Grosskopf, chief executive of Sprott Inc.\\n\\nAgainst that backdrop, larger capitalization companies are trading at increasingly bigger stock premiums compared with smaller miners, and they end up with much lower costs of capital as a result.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in the business for 30-plus years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as dramatic a difference as it became over the last year and a half,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Grosskopf said of the divergence in the cost of capital between large and small miners.\\n\\nThe last time the gold industry went through such an intense round of consolidation was about a decade ago. But many of those deals turned out badly, with companies overpaying for assets that never delivered anywhere close to their promise. Barrick Gold Corp.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $7.3-billion acquisition of copper producer Equinox Minerals Ltd. and Kinross Gold Corp.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s US$7.1-billion acquisition of Red Back Mining Inc. are prime examples.\\n\\nThis time around, companies have at least been more disciplined when it comes to price. Takeover premiums have ranged from Barrick\\xe2\\x80\\x99s zero-premium acquisition of Randgold Resources, to Newmont\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slim 17-per-cent premium for Goldcorp, to Kirkland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting-up-there 24-per-cent premium for Detour.\\n\\nWhile the ultimate success or failure of any individual M&A deal likely won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be evident until a few years out, one thing is clear \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the lower the takeover premium, the better the transactions have been received by the market.\\n\\nIn an online commentary in November, portfolio manager Joe Foster with New York-based Van Eck & Associates wrote that more gold companies should take a page out of the Barrick and Randgold playbook and consider teaming up in zero-premium mergers, rather than holding out for juicy premiums.\\n\\nLooking at why more of these kinds of deals hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t materialized, Mr. Foster concluded that management teams are often more concerned about protecting their own jobs, rather than doing the right thing for shareholders.\\n\\nOne of the few zero-premium deals announced in 2019 was Equinox Gold Corp.'s $770-million proposed merger with Leagold Mining Corp., which was warmly received by shareholders on both sides.\\n\\nYour time is valuable.

Hope with an outstanding and deep Junior class, whereas Trine has 3 Soph\\'s leading in scoring. The big question at the beginning of the year was how far would Trine regress this year after an outstanding Senior class graduated that led Trine to 3 consecutive NCAA tournaments. This team does not have a \"go to\" player like Dawson who could single handily take over games if needed over her career. We have one Senior, two Juniors, and the rest Soph\\'s and Freshman in the top 11 rotation.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know Hope is going to pressure the ball and get scores off their defense. You don\\'t see many D3 teams with their length inside either. Our bigs Taylor and Herbert will need to play well and stay out of foul trouble. If were shooting the 3ball decently we\\'ll have a shot to be there at the end, but I am going with Hope by 10+ in this one as they have more experience and playmakers than Trine.',\n",

The district TMC leaders have organised flag-hoisting programmes and street corner meetings to discuss and highlight the achievements of the state government and speak against the amended Citizenship Act, party sources said. Banerjee, who has been at the forefront in opposing the CAA and nation-wide NRC, has been crisscrossing the state, holding protest marches and rallies against the new citizenship law. On the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foundation day, TMC activists also organised blood donation camps in several parts of the state.\\n\\nThe TMC was founded by Mamata Banerjee on January 1, 1998 with an aim to oust the then Left Front regime from power.

       "        b'I know, I know: \"All things in moderation.\" I grew up with that little piece of wisdom, too. Having said that, I also have to point to the confusion I felt when I read Jesus\\' response to it: \"If you be neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth\" (Revelations 3:16). The translation of that, for those who can possibly wonder, is \"Stand up.\" Stand for something. Stand up and take a position. Loudly, if necessary. Don\\'t just wait to see how things come out. Add to the conversation. Add to the wisdom. Add to the questions that surround it. Add the ideas you\\'ve learned somewhere else so that others can mull them over, too. And whatever you do, don\\'t, as the Irish say, \"Fall between two stools.\"\\n\\nThe trouble is that we have whole audiences caught between stools right now. They\\'re confused about which side to sit on. They\\'re uncertain about what position to take, so they step back and let someone else do their thinking for them. Members of Congress who swallow their consciences to please the system rather than the Gospel are not going to stand for anything. Surely the wealthy who vote for their stock returns and their tax reductions rather than for the upbuilding of the needs of the entire nation are not going to worry about little things \\xe2\\x80\\x95 like somebody else\\'s poverty. And without doubt, average persons who can\\'t tell the political lies from the truth anymore may know what\\'s right in their hearts but have no idea what happened to the congressional process that once decided those things together. So inured are we to alternative facts, competing values, unclear constitutional interpretations, and the difference between national laws and, well, the rise of an imperial presidency, it\\'s impossible to know who knows what. When a \"royal presidency\" \\xe2\\x80\\x95 an oxymoron in itself, like bittersweet or open secrets or living deaths \\xe2\\x80\\x95 suddenly outranks any other law-making force in the country, the people who\\'ve been lied to quit believing in facts all together. Now \"facts\" are just one more movable feast. \"They all lie,\" people say of politicians and national agencies and the media and even of the scientists they\\'ve been taught to doubt so that corporations don\\'t have to make any ecological changes to their products or processes. Indeed, the people have been taught to doubt, so now government and science are begging us to save ourselves because it is already too late to debate climate change. But how can we save anything while we keep rolling back ecological regulations for the sake of short-term corporate profiteering? How is a nation supposed to trust anyone or any laws at all when the president himself, having declared himself above it, simply deals with the law by refusing to keep it, to honor it, to submit to its review and validation? In the face of that kind of reasoning, tell your teenager that we\\'re a country of laws and hear the laughter in the background. Only this time, it\\'s at you.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nIn a world such as that, maybe it\\'s just better to keep your head down, many think, and follow the herd rather than risk attention, or worse, risk public disapproval. Do little and say nothing at all has become the new definition of peace and security in a land of political turmoil and working families living in tent cities due to the lack of a decent minimum wage and to the disappearance of low-cost housing. This, while at the same time, they tell us the economy is soaring for some while we\\'re spending money building walls instead of raising the minimum wage to a living wage. I give up: Where\\'s the moderation? In fact, is moderation moral when topics such as those aren\\'t even being discussed and debated in the highest level in government? So much for democracy. We\\'ve seen democracies destroyed. But it is just as possible to simply let ours die on the vine from the plague of federal indifference. In a between-the-stools population and political system, being neither hot nor cold has become a fine art. It has its own set of norms, of course: As in, \"Say nothing about what you don\\'t like. Be silent and hope this awful nightmare finally ends. Move over and make room for the white nationalists, the racists, the automatic rifles, the new elected monarchy.\" After all, \"there were very fine people on both sides,\" right? The problem? The whole scene has the tone of \"The Handmaid\\'s Tale.\" Everybody\\'s lined up, smiling a pasted-down smile, sure that the world can be saved despite the fact that few are saying anything to save it. Like demand gun laws. Like rejoin the Paris climate agreement. Like stop the tariff war. Like impose ecological regulations immediately before the next city is underwater and the poor have no water at all. No, moderation won\\'t do it. What we need now is Christian extremism, the idea that there are some things that cannot be tolerated in life, that there is something we can do to resolve these logjams if we really want to do it. These are the people who are \"either hot or cold.\" And Jesus loves them. Christian extremism is extremely concerned about what this era of insult and mockery has sown. We need people who don\\'t change TV news channels because the news \"depresses\" them. Instead they listen carefully to understand what needs to be done and they join mixed groups to start doing it. Locally as well as globally. Christian extremists are extremely open to new ideas. They read good articles carefully. They call for the creation of mixed groups to consider what can be done about issues on a local level. They find out from local officials what can be done to control guns, for instance, and provide medical care, and start subsidized housing, and invest in ecological preservation. They take part in democracy, in other words, as any citizen who wants to keep it must do.',\n",

Though the note was not clear, it had a mention of some issues related to custom and penalties.

       "        b'Get our ultimate guide to things to do with DevonLive\\'s FREE What\\'s On newsletter\\n\\nAccording to the Fitness Industry Association, 12 per cent of gym memberships are taken out in January - and most people will have already stopped going withing six months.\\n\\nAnd it is easy to see why: gyms can be daunting places for the initiated, full of monstrously heavy weights, bizarre looking machines and muscle-bound athletes pumping iron.\\n\\nThere is also a tempting array of ways to injure/embarrass yourself, all of which often leads to us either not going anymore, or simply cancelling our membership.\\n\\nDevon Live caught up with former Exeter Chiefs player Sam Blythe, founder of Fitness Matters on Marsh Barton in Exeter, to offer some tips about how to avoid easy mistakes and make sure the gym is for life, not just for Christmas.\\n\\n1) Too much too soon\\n\\n\"People are often so super keen when they join a gym in January that they are possibly just doing too much too soon. They need to take small steps.\\n\\n\"Some people are coming to the gym after a little while out, but others \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the best will in the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are not so clued up and maybe take on too much too soon.\\n\\n\"It\\'s much better to start slowly and take your time.\"\\n\\n2)It\\'s good to talk\\n\\n\"It is worth having a chat with a few people, taking your time and getting some advice along the way. That will give you real structure and a plan. Then you are way more likely to keep it going.\\n\\n\"If you are somebody who has spent a lot of time in the gym but just lost a bit of momentum along the way then you probably won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need any advice, but if you are new then speak to someone.\\n\\n\"Any environment you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know is daunting so sitting own and having a chat with someone who works there or a PT for a bit of confidence or guidance to get a nudge in the right direction is no bad thing.\"\\n\\n3) Plan your routine\\n\\n\"I would suggest those people who are new to a gym just give a little bit of thought to what you might do. A lot of people get on the gym floor, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing and end up just doing the same few exercises day after day. It pays to sit down the night before and have a think about it so you have a way forward.\\n\\n\"You want to be healthy for ever, not just January.\"\\n\\n4) Warm up...\\n\\n\"A warm-up is always going to help you.\\n\\n\"Make your warm-up specific to what you are going to do. There is no point in warming up a part of your body you are not then going to use.\\n\\n\"It needs to be specific to what you are going to do. If you want to improve your running, you are not going to just jump on a treadmill and start sprinting right away. It just needs a little bit of common sense.\\n\\n5) ...and cool down\\n\\n\"Cooling down and stretching is often very overlooked. People often don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it because it is harder to see the benefits when you are doing it looking in the mirror.\\n\\n\"People often just want to lose weight and look better, but often stretching and cooling down will help you avoid injury and recover more quickly, which means you can spend more time exercising and, in the long run, will look better anyway.\"\\n\\n6) Be patient\\n\\n\"From a technical point of view, it is important not to rush into things without knowing what you are doing first. You could end up injuring yourself or not getting the results you hoped for.\\n\\n\"Mentally, it is just like going on a diet. When you try and change something overnight often it will only last for a week or two and then you get resentful and fall off the wagon and you are back to square one. You want to keep it sustainable, which begins with a steady start to get the snowball rolling.\"\\n\\n7) Find your lifestyle balance\\n\\n\"You have to find a lifestyle that is sustainable to yourself. That is different for everybody \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what is a sacrifice to one person isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily to another. It is about finding what works for you and sticking to that.\"\\n\\n8) Gym goals\\n\\n\"Different people have different ways of doing it. Some people are very goals-driven, and soon fall off the wagon if they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have something to aim for. Other people like just ticking over and staying fit.\\n\\n\"Overall, I think staying healthy is important, but if you can find a challenge to give you that little spike from time to time then that is great.\"\\n\\n9) An all-round approach to exercising\\n\\n\"In my opinion, it is about having the best all-round approach.\\n\\n\"It depends how structured you want to be when you start going to the gym and what your goals are, but the all-round package in terms of exercising and living is very important.\\n\\n\"You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be the master of everything. If you do 80 per cent of things right, the other 20 per cent will take care of itself.\"',\n",

       "        b'| By\\n\\nThere are different processes one must undergo for immigration, that some people get confused with all the to-dos in the checklist and ends up getting stressed about the littlest things. In planning for immigration, there are certain things that you should take note of.\\n\\nThe Immigration Process\\n\\nImmigration to another country requires a due process that needs to be fulfilled. For countries like the U.S., their immigration process is lengthy and costly. The usual procedure for the immigration process is first, the acquiring of the immigrant visa to be eligible for legal permanent residency.\\n\\nAn immigrant visa can be acquired in four ways (on U.S. standards and legal procedures). These are family-based, employment-based, asylum and refugee status or diversity lottery.\\n\\nAside from the immigrant visa, it should be verified that the immigrant has no criminal records to be issued a legal permanent residency.\\n\\nThe processes for immigration can be too complex. Hiring an immigration attorney would not only lessen the burden on you, you can also be assured that the legal processes are duly followed.\\n\\nAs mentioned, the whole immigration process can be a bit complicated. To avoid unnecessary troubles along the way, here are some tips when planning for immigration to another place.\\n\\nTips in Planning for Immigration\\n\\nAll requested forms and information should be submitted in advance. Be certain that everything indicated are true and correct.\\n\\nBe ready for any delays. Submitting the forms in an earlier date will buy you more time for preparation.\\n\\nYou should also have a copy of all the documents you have passed to the authorities.\\n\\nBe respectful to immigration authorities and be on time if there are scheduled appointments or interviews.\\n\\nBetter to follow all the steps legally. Avoid any shortcut methods to prevent any trouble.\\n\\nHire an efficient and competent immigration lawyer. If your situation is complicated or you find the whole process overwhelming, then legal assistance would be needed. Your lawyer must be an expert in immigration cases.\\n\\nThough the whole immigration process might be tiring and would require much effort, time and money, following these tips might alleviate some of the burden on you. Although the legal processes are important, better be prepared of other things you might encounter a problem with in the future.\\n\\nOther Things to Consider in Planning for Immigration\\n\\nYou should have at least a brief background or knowledge about the country you are going to.\\n\\nIf the country or place you are planning to move on to speak a different language, better start learning the basics that would be enough for you to survive daily conversations.\\n\\nEven if the whole process can be tedious, the primary advice for a successful immigration is persistence.',\n",

At first, it was slow to break through, muddied by a slew of scandals: fraud, thefts and scams that turned away many and brought closer regulatory scrutiny. But once it burst into the mainstream, it proved to be the decade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best-performing asset.\\n\\nThe largest digital token, trading around $7,200, has posted gains of more than 9,000,000% since July 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBitcoin really captured that wild technology enthusiasm that \\xe2\\x80\\x98this time is different,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter Atwater, the president of Financial Insyghts and an adjunct professor at William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va.\\n\\nThe performance over the past 10 years, even with its huge run-up and subsequent mega-crash, leaves all others in the dust. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a massive windfall for those who \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to use the lingo of the crypto crowd \\xe2\\x80\\x94 HODL\\xe2\\x80\\x99ed through its ups and downs, even as it continues to provide fodder for get-rich-quick schemes. For some, the never-ending fantasy of continually hitting that payoff still helps to keep Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s momentum going.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNothing else comes even close to beating it. The S&P 500 merely tripled in that period. An index that tracks world markets has more than doubled. Gold is up 25%. Some of the best-performing stocks in the Russell 3000 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including Exact Sciences Corp. and Intelligent Systems Corp. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are each up about 3,000%. Those gains pale in comparison to the finance world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and one of its most controversial -- marvels.\\n\\nPartly, the monster return is a reflection of the calculus behind Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jumping-off point: the token wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worth anything when someone named Satoshi Nakamoto launched it on Halloween 2008. Designed as a method of exchange that can be sent electronically between users around the world, it did not have a centralized control network. Bitcoin, instead, is run by a network of computers that keep track of all transactions on the blockchain ledger. For many, that technology was reason enough to buy into the idea.\\n\\nOn the other side of the equation are Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s devoted enthusiasts who saw in its technology a promising way to change the global financial system.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the first time that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a real separation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just like church and state \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you have a separation of money and state,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Alex Mashinsky, founder of Celsius Network, a crypto lending platform. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the innovation, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the excitement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Bitcoin was slow to take off, notching its first transaction two years after its creation, when someone used it to buy pizza. Since then, the first-born token\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price has catapulted, doubling many times over, and hundreds of imitators have cropped up \\xe2\\x80\\x94 some with more success than others.\\n\\nMany of those who got in early stayed faithful, watching as it made its way through a boom and bust cycle unrivaled by almost anything else over the last decade.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2017, Bitcoin jumped above $1,000. By mid-summer, it had more than doubled. Insanity was unleashed. By year-end, it hovered above $14,000. But as swiftly as it ran up, it fell even faster. By the end of 2018, Bitcoin barely budged above $3,000. Yet shortly after its crash, it embarked on another huge rally, this time reaching as high as $13,800 in the summer of 2019.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly the numbers are what appeals to investors,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe next 10 years need to be a totally different stage of growth based on totally different factors than the first stage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs much as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made a fortune for speculators and some thieves, Bitcoin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s survival will rest on further adoption. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not being used as a widespread medium of exchange. A few large retailers are accepting payment in Bitcoin but there hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been the large-scale embrace so many had predicted. Scams are still running rampant. Interest is waning and consolidation among large owners is at a higher level than it was during the height of the 2017 bubble, which means that their influence over prices could be increasing.\\n\\nProjections for the next decade abound. In the 2020s, mass adoption is surely to take off, they say. Blockchain technology will revolutionize and solve every problem in the world. On the other hand, regulatory scrutiny is likely to intensify, with central bankers paying closer attention than ever before.\\n\\nIn the more immediate term, some speculators forecast 2020 might be less fraught with volatility given its upcoming halving, whereby the number of coins awarded to so-called miners who process transactions is cut by 50%. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s set to happen in May 2020 (the internet is replete with countdown clocks). The coin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s previous cut, about four years ago, coincided with a run-up in its price, pushing many crypto evangelist to believe in a repeat.\\n\\nTo CoinList\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Andy Bromberg, the halving is already priced in. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been overpriced in and everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bought into this thesis and we see a dip post-halving,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s co-founder and president in an interview. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat would not shock me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut beyond next year, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBitcoin is finding its own narrative as digital gold,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt feels like that narrative is picking up steam and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breaking away on its own.

In an unprecedented appeal, the Rural Fire Service said anyone in the southeastern tip of the state should get out in the next two days. The 230-kilometer (143-mile) stretch from Batemans Bay down to the Victoria state border has been ravaged by fires this week, producing apocalyptic scenes as infernos turned the sky blood red and rained down embers and ash on communities. At least seven people have been killed on the south coast of New South Wales just this week and hundreds of properties destroyed. Right now, isolated communities in Victoria remain cut off by road, including the township of Mallacoota, where some 4,000 people were forced to shelter on the beach or escape by boat as wildfires swept through.

The North Korean leader told a gathering of party officials in Pyongyang that U.S. actions left him no choice but to reconsider commitments that underpinned three unprecedented meetings with Trump over the past 18 months, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday.

The speech came during an unusual four-day party meeting and appeared to replace the televised address Kim has delivered every New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day since 2013.

And then adding someone like Rory to the mix, the sky\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the limit for PFL \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of discussions with other people that are interested and want to come over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAlso on the agenda moving forward is the possibility of superfights. Featherweight champ Lance Palmer and lightweight champ Natan Schulte were two names that were brought up as suggestions for a potential superfight, and while only Palmer seemed quite keen, Sefo likes the idea in general.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot in the works for PFL, and those were part of discussions along the way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sefo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot necessarily Natan and Lance, but we talked about doing some superfights and whatnot. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of the plan. Whether it happens next year or the year after that, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure exactly. But there are discussions in terms of putting on some superfights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe ESPN deal was arguably the biggest development for the promotion this year, giving the fighters the largest platform possible, to showcase their skills.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cESPN has been great,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sefo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a great partner and the fact we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on ESPN speaks volumes. It just goes to show that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and it sends a message out there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that PFL is here and that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re alive and well and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to continue to sign some big names and continue to grow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       "        b\"What is a food desert? Imagine having to get all of your groceries from a gas station or local corner store bodega where you're forced to select bags of chips and frozen pizza as sustenance. This is the reality for the millions of citizens who live in food deserts in the United States. The United States lacks equal access to food across communities and food availability is scarce in portions of the country known as food deserts.\\n\\nIn 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture performed a food access study and defined a US food desert as an area where 33 percent of a city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residents live more than one mile from a supermarket and 20 percent earn below the poverty line. Many residents of food desert locations do not have cars and lack access to public transportation, making them essentially unable to get to a grocery store. Food desert causes are mostly related to economics. Big chain supermarkets have a hard time turning a profit in impoverished areas, which results in places without food cropping up across the country. The effects are devastating. The obesity rates in these areas are generally higher, meaning life-threatening illnesses like diabetes and heart disease are on the rise. Luckily, new laws and various grassroots organizations are currently working to make healthy, affordable food available nationwide. On a local level, many cities have not just opened up food co-ops and food markets in impoverished areas. Local corner stores are also expanding their inventory. Instead of using all of their shelf space for junk food, they are providing more healthy fresh food options.\\n\\nTo learn more about the issue and what's being done, scan this list of the top food deserts in the United States.\",\n",

The waiting pilgrims had been attempting to kiss his papal ring as part of a tradition, practised by more conservative Catholics, to show respect to the pontiff. A few days after the incident, the Vatican said Francis had been worried about spreading germs. However, experts said at the time that his reluctance to have his papal ring kissed reflected an uneasiness with an element of traditional protocol that had lost its original meaning.',\n",

       "        b'0 SHARES Share Tweet\\n\\nQuebec lottery fans have celebrated quite the cash windfalls over the past twelve months, with bigger and better lotto jackpots making their way to their pockets. Lotto 6/49 was once again among the preferred tickets purchased by many Canadians, but it seemed like many of the cash prizes were eventually drawn to the eastern regions of the country.\\n\\nToday we are going to review some of the heftiest Lotto 6/49 jackpots bagged by Quebec players this year. Purchasing tickets as a group has made the entire gaming experience more special for Canadians, as it makes them feel part of a community that could soon become much richer. This is also true for tickets purchased by couples that have agreed to split the jackpot and invest it in something both individuals would find enjoyable.\\n\\nLotto 6/49 Proves Generosity\\n\\nSuch was the case with a couple hailing from Gatineau that became eligible for a cash windfall of CA$7 million mid-July. Just like many winners before them, the two Lotto 6/49 enthusiasts were in a state of disbelief upon realizing their lives would never be the same again. Colette Laberge and Mario Lafreni\\xc3\\xa8re collected their jackpot and took a photo with the hefty cheque at Casino du Lac-Leamy.\\n\\nThe winging draw for the two of them took place on July 10, highlighting the numbers 07, 15, 22, 28, 43, 49, plus the bonus one 45. Matching the six main numbers sufficed, making their ticket a lucky one indeed. Winners revealed that they had purchased the winning ticket at Uniprix Danyel Dessureault, Place de la Cit\\xc3\\xa9-des-Jeunes.\\n\\nAccording to Loto-Quebec\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulation, every retail point associated with a winning purchase is eligible for a 1-percent slice of the jackpot. This granted the location some CA$70,000, a motivation for many retailers to include lottery offerings in their array of offerings. One of the regular questions, when winners collect their prize, is related to their plans. The Gatineau couple had already come up with a plan that included treating their extended family as well.\\n\\nLarger Prizes Claimed\\n\\nAnother permanent resident of Quebec would forever remember this year as a special one thanks to his lucky Lotto 6/49 ticket purchase. The first days of August were special for Daniel Lavoie of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean who was the proud winner of CA$3.5 million jackpot. This was half of the August 7 Lotto 6/49 Main prize, but still a generous cash pile for the Canadian.\\n\\nAugust 7 brought a Lotto 6/49 draw coming with a CA$7-million prize that was eventually split between the two tickets eligible for it. The numbers drawn at that draw were 05, 08, 09, 19, 28, 31, plus the bonus one 18. Mr. Lavoie purchased his ticket at the Couche-Tard convenience store in Chambord ahead of the lucky draw.\\n\\nJust like every other retail location selling winging tickets, the convenience store received one percent of the payout. In this case this amounted to CA$35,000 piece of the Main prize. The lotto millionaire was certain that he would continue working at least for the time being, despite the windfall. He also began looking for the perfect new home for his family.',\n",

As he spoke, a fleet of U.S. spy planes, based primarily in nearby Okinawa and carrying the most sophisticated surveillance equipment in the world, combed Korean skies looking for any signs of new tests that would violate the moratorium.\\n\\nKim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report to a plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Party \\xe2\\x80\\x93 often described as the DPRK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest decision-making body \\xe2\\x80\\x93 took place after weeks of often frenzied speculation by the US media and North Korea experts about the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChristmas Surprise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that North Korean officials had promised if the Trump administration didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t offer a more constructive proposal for relaxing sanctions and scaling down the confrontation. A week before Christmas, the top U.S. Air Force General in the Pacific boldly predicted the North\\xe2\\x80\\x99s imminent test-firing of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clong-range ballistic missile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThat seemed to release the floodgates for a global guessing game. The degree of tension was apparent two days into the Christmas \\xe2\\x80\\x9csurprise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NHK mistakenly broadcast a false dispatch that the North had indeed tested a new missile. Immediately, and before even confirming the story, leading U.S. analysts began speculating about the possible size and distance of the weapon. After an embarrassed NHK pulled the story, the analysts quickly deleted their tweets, but not before making conjectures that only added to the sense of foreboding.\\n\\nAmong those pulling their tweets was Ankit Panda, an arms control analyst at the Federation of American Scientists who has made a name for himself with his detailed knowledge of North Korean missile technology. Writing for the Daily Beast, which is well-known for its ultra-hawkish coverage of North Korea, Panda called Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s New Year report \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe best indication from Pyongyang that the door on this chapter of rapprochement [with the United States] is shut,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and predicted \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca year that will likely include several missile tests and other demonstrations of military capability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the DPRK.\\n\\nIn its coverage, the Washington Post, too, focused primarily on Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s threats to resume testing, but gave space to Duyeon Kim of the International Crisis Group to caution that Kim had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstill left the door open to diplomacy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The New York Times took a similar approach, noting that Kim had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoderated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his message by not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexplicitly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d saying he was ending his moratorium or terminating negotiations. But it simultaneously ran an op-ed from longtime North Korea critic Nicholas Eberstadt declaring that Kim had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjust restarted his dance of death with America.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       "        b'We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wind up getting that Christmas present from Kim Jong-un that he promised. (Not even the vase that President Trump suggested.) While most of us were expecting either a weapon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s test or a missile launch, all remained quiet in the hermit nation for the remainder of the year. But this morning the dictator released a statement through his country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s state-run media outlets that appears to explain what the real \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpresent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was going to be. As of today, North Korea is no longer considering itself bound to the weapons testing moratorium agreed to between Kim and Trump. (NY Times)\\n\\nNorth Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leader, Kim Jong-un, \\xe2\\x80\\x8bsaid his country no longer felt bound by its self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, its official media reported on Wednesday, the strongest indication yet that the country could soon resume such tests\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 North Korea has not conducted a long-range missile test or a nuclear test in more than two years. Mr. Kim had announced his moratorium at a time when he hoped negotiations with the United States \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and his budding personal relationship with President Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would prompt the United States to begin lifting crippling sanctions.\\n\\nKim was still being rather vague about what he plans to do, but he promised that the world would soon see a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew strategic weapon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d being deployed from the Korean Peninsula. (The Hill)\\n\\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned the world will witness \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca new strategic weapon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the isolated nation in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnear future\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang are stuck in a stalemate. According to reports of his remarks from North Korean state media, Kim blasted the U.S. for its \\xe2\\x80\\x9chostile policy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d toward North Korea and said he had no expectation Washington would lift sanctions on his country soon.\\n\\nReached for comment at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump appeared to discount the threat, saying that he still believes Kim Jong-un is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca man of his word\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and will find a way to close the deal. Of course, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty much been Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s modus operandi throughout this entire process. Keep flattering Kim while refusing to give in to his demands. And Trump will no doubt continue to play nice until it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time get tough.\\n\\nAs long as North Korea is only talking about violating the agreement and not actually doing it, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still time to cut a deal. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even conceivable that Trump could put some small concession on the table along the lines of a partial withdrawal of one or two minor sanctions. That would at least give Kim something to take home and claim a victory if he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s willing to at least continue the moratorium, if not actually start dismantling his nukes.\\n\\nBut in reality, those nukes are the only thing keeping Kim in power, at least in his view. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost impossible to conceive of him really carrying through on a comprehensive denuclearization program.\\n\\nSo if he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, what might the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew strategic weapon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d be? Intelligence analysts seem to think it will be one of two things. Either he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll light off a fully functional hydrogen bomb or he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll test an ICBM with solid fuel propellant that can definitely make it all the way across the Pacific to the west coast of the United States. Either one would be provocative in the extreme and send us right back to where we were stuck before Trump reached out to him.\\n\\n2020 may be starting off on an upward path domestically but in terms of our negotiations with North Korea, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already hitting a sour note. And with Russia and China courting Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favor these days, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not particularly hopeful of the situation improving any time soon.',\n",

       "        b'This coming March, it will have been 10 years since Ryan Westmoreland experienced the scariest day of his life. He was on an operating table at St. Joseph\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix as Dr. Robert Spetzler prepped for a five-hour procedure to remove a cavernous malformation on his brain stem.\\n\\nAt the time, Westmoreland was the No. 1 prospect in the Boston Red Sox organization and the 21st-ranked minor league player in all of baseball. But as doctors started to put the former Portsmouth High School star under anesthesia, his thoughts didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t drift toward a future career in the bigs and he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dwelling on when he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get back on the field.\\n\\nHe was praying he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d make it through alive.\\n\\nNearly a decade has passed since March 16, 2010 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the date of that surgery, which is emblazoned on his arm with a tattoo \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and on the anniversary, Westmoreland will be back on the field as an assistant coach on Bob Prince\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staff at UMass Dartmouth.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was perfect. I had lost two of my assistant coaches to head coaching jobs, and I had been passively looking [to replace them],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prince said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe timing couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been any better. I reached out to Ryan and it went from there. We had a nice conversation in regards to the program and his role, his expectations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWestmoreland is currently working with teenage players with the Ocean State Makos, an AAU team. And, in a way, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how he ended up with the Corsairs. He was touting some of his players to Rian McCarthy, an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator with UMass Dartmouth. McCarthy, who had previously coached the Post 18 American Legion team in Newport, asked Westmoreland if he had considered coaching at the next level.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said absolutely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Westmoreland said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reaching out for jobs, but he asked me if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be interested, I talked with Coach Prince and it snowballed from there. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m excited.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen Westmoreland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s professional baseball career ended in 2013, he never envisioned himself as a coach. But after starting with the Portsmouth High School freshman team in 2015, then working with the Makos, he realized he could impart his vast knowledge of the game on the next generation of future stars.\\n\\nAnd he found it quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I retired, I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dead set on being a coach,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Westmoreland said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe first year I coached, I said to myself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I have a lot of knowledge and things I can teach.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Not only the physical, but also the mental part of the game. I can teach what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned and then watch them to grow up and be successful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWestmoreland was a star at Portsmouth High School, twice named the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gatorade Player of the Year, before graduating in 2008. That year, he was chosen by the Red Sox in the fifth round of the MLB First-Year Player draft. A five-tool player with tremendous potential, Westmoreland by the end of his second professional season was named the club\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top prospect.\\n\\nBut early in 2010, he felt tingling in his fingers and realized something wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t right. Westmoreland had a cavernous malformation on his brain stem that required a dangerous surgical procedure. He attempted a comeback and was invited to Red Sox spring training in 2011, but a second surgery forced him to give up the game he loves so much at just 22 years old.\\n\\nThere were some dark times, but Westmoreland found solace in coaching. Now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take the next step in what he hopes is a lifelong endeavor. With UMass Dartmouth, Westmoreland said he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a defined role, but is willing to do what is asked of him.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xb3[Coach Prince] just said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98We want you to be part of our program,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And that was huge for me, because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never coached in college,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Westmoreland said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looks like whatever I can do to help the team, and whatever Coach Prince wants me to do, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy to do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPrince knows what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting in Westmoreland.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe brings a lot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prince said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust the experience in terms of playing and the process and the grind that these kids go through. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been working with kids who are at a high level. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been successful at developing players, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re about \\xe2\\x80\\x94 developing players and people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPrince said Westmoreland isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hesitant to talk about what happened 10 years ago, and that most of the players already know his story. Infielder JR DiSarcina is the son of Gary DiSarcina, who was the manager of the Lowell Spinners when Westmoreland was with the club in 2009.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen [the players] caught wind of what was going on, we were all on a group text, and one of the players said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh my God, I have his rookie card and he autographed it for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 The kids know who he is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prince said.\\n\\nFor Westmoreland, this coaching position could be a stepping stone.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really hope it opens that door,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Westmoreland said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEver since I started coaching, I knew I wanted a future in this. I was looking to get into the college baseball world, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see where it goes from there. But this is a great opportunity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd he has a backer in Prince.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe wants to be involved in baseball at a high level, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coaching in college, professionally or scouting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prince said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy job, as it is with my players, is to help him get him to where he wants to go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d',\n",

I moved there and we bought a house together.\\n\\nBut we both found that we just weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t compatible. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very laid-back; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hyperactive by comparison.\\n\\nSince we had no children, we agreed to part in an amicable divorce.\\n\\nI decided to go home for a visit, and scout the chances for work.\\n\\nBy luck, I was offered a terrific job and decided to stay.

Reach out to your contacts where you lived for five years, and ask them to refer you to a reliable shipping company.

Kim is not crazy nor is he suicidal. His goal is not to start a nuclear war that will spark a massive U.S. retaliation that would destroy his country and could result in his own death. His goal is to get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without giving up his nukes.\\n\\nAll it would take is the nuclear weapons aboard just one U.S. Navy ballistic submarine \\xe2\\x80\\x93 carrying an astounding 192 nuclear warheads \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to wipe out North Korea in roughly 20 minutes. Its population of 25 million people would be killed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all from just one submarine lurking below the surface in the Pacific Ocean \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and Kim knows that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some real \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfire and fury.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe North Korean dictator \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who follows his grandfather and father in leading his nation like a communist hereditary monarch \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has a clearly established goal we can all relate to: survival.\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get one thing straight. Kim is not crazy nor is he suicidal. His goal is not to start a nuclear war that will spark a massive U.S. retaliation that would destroy his country and could result in his own death. His goal is to get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without giving up his nukes.\\n\\nKim believes that his nuclear weapons are the ultimate insurance policy against an attack by the U.S., South Korea or any other nation aiming to overthrow his regime.\\n\\nKim knows that U.S. and United Nations forces attacked his country in the Korean War, and is well aware that American forces have waged long wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq in the years since. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any foreign forces seeking regime change in a second Korean War with either a conventional or a nuclear attack \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and knows his nukes can act as a deterrent to prevent that.\\n\\nNorth Korea has made huge sacrifices to build up its small but very dangerous arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles. Although the nation has an economy smaller than the state of Montana and can barely feed its own people, it has beaten the odds to join the nuclear club.\\n\\nBut because the North has spent huge sums of money and endured years of international economic sanctions to go nuclear, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not realistic to expect to Kim to simply hand over all his nuclear bombs and missiles to the U.S. anytime soon.\\n\\nDemanding such a full denuclearization in return for eventual sanctions relief \\xe2\\x80\\x93 something that would take years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is not a policy at all, but a recipe for disaster, simply ensuring that Kim builds more and bigger nuclear weapons.\\n\\nA senior White House adviser told me that he considers North Korea \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca fourth-world nation that could kill 100 million people in an hour \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just with nukes, never mind all those chemical and biological weapons. North Korea is a Pandora\\xe2\\x80\\x99s box that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you open it with military force \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will spark at the very least a mini Armageddon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFrom all of this, a very clear strategy can emerge for the Trump administration if it can take a more long-term approach. The administration needs to understand that for at least the short to medium term, North Korea will be unwilling to give up its nuclear arms \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the regime said as much just weeks ago.\\n\\nFor now, Team Trump must focus on starving the regime of any resources it can get its hands on to advance its nuclear program through the tightest sanctions possible and depriving the Kim family of any technology that could advance such a cause.\\n\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just the beginning. Washington must also ensure that Pyongyang does not sell any of its nuclear or missile technology. There is clear evidence that North Korea and Iran have traded such knowledge over the years.\\n\\nAmerica must do all it can to ensure that such transfers stop and that no other nation gains from North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuclear advances \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and prevent Pyongyang from making money off them to advance its weapons of mass destruction programs.\\n\\nSuch a policy of what amounts to a Cold War-style containment must be matched by a willingness to continue dialogue. The history of U.S.-North Korea relations is filled with too many ups and downs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 tensions and breakthroughs that are too dangerous to continue.\\n\\nWe must be willing to try and remove the reasons that North Korea feels it needs nuclear weapons. That can only be done by building trust. As a start, a formal peace declaration ending the Korean War should be signed. In addition, liaison offices should be set up in each nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital to ensure a crisis does not end up in a shooting war.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nFrom there, both sides should work on small steps to remove all military threats facing the other \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both nuclear and conventional. In fact, we should make the nuclear disarmament of North Korea the end goal of a long-term policy shift that could take years but lead to a more stable, less up-and-down relationship.\\n\\nNone of this will be easy. In fact, it would be much easier to do what every other U.S. administration has done on North Korea: confront the regime when it acts aggressively, punish it with sanctions and sound tough, but then move on to the next global crisis or challenge at home when missiles stop heading skyward. That would be a mistake.\\n\\nEventually, President Trump or a future president may reluctantly come to the painful conclusion that getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons is as impossible as trying to get Russia, China, India, Pakistan, or another member of the nuclear club to turn back the clock and give up its nukes.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nShould that day come, our fallback position should be to press for an arms control agreement to limit the North Korean nuclear force to the smallest size possible in return for normalized relations.\\n\\nPast U.S. leaders weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happy when the Soviet Union and China went nuclear \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prepared to start a nuclear war to force their denuclearization.

He also appeared to leave the door open for eventual negotiations with the U.S.\\n\\nKim has used the diplomatic stalemate to expand his military capabilities by intensifying tests of shorter-range weapons. His arsenal is now estimated to include 40 to 50 nuclear bombs and various delivery systems, including solid-fuel missiles designed to beat missile-defense systems and developmental ICBMs potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.\\n\\nKim has also strengthened his negotiating position, moving the diplomacy closer to an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states rather than talks that would culminate in a unilateral surrender of the weapons he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.\\n\\nHARRY KAZIANIS: NORTH KOREA\\xe2\\x80\\x99S KIM HAS THIS GOAL IN MIND (NO, HE\\xe2\\x80\\x99S NOT CRAZY).

       "        b\"If a patient suspected of having the virus has attended the surgery, PHE says the room they were seen in should not be used until it has been cleaned with detergent and disinfectant. All items used to care for the patient should be bagged as clinical waste, including the contents of the bin, and quarantined until it is known whether the patient has tested positive for WN-CoV.\\n\\nFabric curtains and screens should also be bagged as infectious linen, while any cloths or mop heads used during cleaning should be disposed of as single use items.\\n\\nIf the patient spent any time in communal areas, these should be cleaned with detergent and disinfectant as soon as possible.\\n\\nAccording to the initial guidance, GPs who suspect a patient could have the virus during a consultation should leave the room immediately, leaving the patient and their belongings inside, wash their hands and conduct the remainder of the consultation by phone. They should also contact the local health protection team.\\n\\nIf GPs suspect a patient has the virus during a telephone consultation they should avoid a face-to-face assessment in primary care and instead call the local secondary care infection specialist.\\n\\nSpread of coronavirus\\n\\nSo far no known cases of WN-CoV have been reported in the UK. On Friday, England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said that the risk to the UK public remains low. However he added: 'there may well be cases in the UK at some stage'.\\n\\n'We have tried and tested measures in place to respond. The UK is well prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases,' Professor Whitty said.\\n\\n\\n\\n'We have global experts monitoring the situation around the clock and have a strong track record of managing new forms of infectious disease. We have access to some of the best infectious disease and public health experts in the world from around the UK.'\\n\\nAccording to the BBC the number of confirmed cases of the virus in China has reached 2,827 and the number of deaths has risen to 81. At least 20 Chinese cities have been placed on lockdown in an attempt to prevent the virus spreading.\\n\\nCases have also been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France and Australia.\",\n",
